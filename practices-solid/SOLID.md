##Single responsibility principle

> A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.

##Open close principle

> Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification
 
***This mean that a class should be extendable without modifying the class itself.***

##Liskov substitution

##Interface segregation

> A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use, or clients shouldnâ€™t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

***Every shape has an area but not every shape has volume.*** </br>

ðŸ›‘ ***This way we will force all shapes which don't have volume to implement it*** ðŸ›‘ </br>
âœ… ***The right way is to create separate interface for shapes with volume*** âœ…

##Dependency inversion

> Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.

> This principle allows for decoupling

ðŸ›‘ ***This way the PasswordReminder constructor depends on concretion*** ðŸ›‘</br>
ðŸ›‘ ***Later, if you were to change the database engine, you would also have to change PasswordReminder*** ðŸ›‘

âœ… Better approach is every connection to have interface implement to it. </br>
âœ… PasswordReminder will accept as type this interface.
